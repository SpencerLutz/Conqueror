# Conqueror
A Java game about building a nation and conquering your enemies

Heres a tutorial I wrote for the game in 2017 (Hopefully it makes sense)

How to play:  
To start, click anywhere on the window to place your starting city.  
You can then build farms and mines on your property, which is highlighted in red. (Each farm or mine costs 10 gold)  
To place a mine, press “M” and click the desired tile. You will notice the word “Mine” shows up at the top right corner.  
Similarly, press “F” to change to farm mode and click the desired tile.  
Farms produce food for your empire, while mines produce gold.  
If you still enough gold remaining after building all of the improvements you can, you can change to upgrade mode with the “U” key. Upgrades cost 10 gold.  
Press enter to take your turn. This is when the enemy empires will place their cities.  
Once you have enough gold, you can create another city with the “C” key. These cost 300 gold.  
After this you can repeat the process to expand your empire.  
You can also create units with the “U” key. These units can be sent to explore the map and reveal the grey areas. Units cost 50 gold.  
Whlie in Unit mode, you can also move your units. To do this, click the unit you want to use and press arrow key of the desired direction.  

Notes:  
Pressing R toggles the resource view. See how much gold and food a tile yields.  
Pressing O toggles the territory view - see who owns a tile.  
N and K also do something, I don't remember what though.  
I'm not sure what happened to unit functionality. To be completely honest I think this is an incomplete version of the game, and the complete one got lost in my files somewhere. There are some features that I remember existing in the finished product that I'm not sure I see here. Apologies for that and if I ever find the complete one, I'll be sure to post it here.
